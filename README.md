## 🩸 Features 🩸

#### 👁️‍🗨️ **<ins>_First-Person Exploration_</ins>**
- Free movement and camera control in a 3D environment
- Immersive abandoned psychiatric hospital setting

The game is experienced from a first-person perspective, allowing the player to move freely and control the camera in a fully 3D environment. The abandoned psychiatric hospital is designed to feel enclosed and unsettling, with long corridors, forgotten rooms, and dim lighting that encourage slow, cautious exploration. Movement itself becomes part of the tension, as the player is never certain what they might encounter next.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ **<ins>_Narrative-Driven Gameplay_</ins>**
- Story revealed through written notes and voice-over logs
- First-person narration from medical staff on night shifts
- Gradual uncovering of truth vs hallucination

The story is not presented directly, but gradually revealed through written notes and voice-over logs scattered throughout the hospital. Many of these accounts come from medical staff working night shifts, capturing moments of fear, doubt, and confusion. As more pieces are discovered, the player begins to question whether the events described are supernatural in nature or the result of human actions and psychological breakdowns.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ **<ins>_Interactive Notes System_</ins>**
- Readable notes placed throughout the map
- Optional voice-over audio for notes
- Smooth UI transitions with pause handling

Notes can be found and read throughout the map, each contributing a small but important fragment of the overall narrative. Some notes include optional voice-over narration, allowing the player to hear the emotional state behind the written words. Opening and closing notes transitions smoothly into and out of gameplay, maintaining immersion while temporarily shifting the player into a focused reading experience.

#### 👁️‍🗨️ **<ins>_Audio-Based Atmosphere_</ins>**
- Environmental ambience and sound effects
- Voice-over narration for intro and notes
- Psychological horror sound design

Sound is used to quietly shape the player’s experience rather than overwhelm it. The hospital is filled with low, constant ambience-distant echoes, faint mechanical hums, and sounds that are difficult to place. Voice-over narration appears during the introduction and in selected notes, adding a human presence to otherwise empty spaces. The audio design focuses on psychological discomfort, creating unease through silence, subtle cues, and uncertainty instead of sudden or aggressive effects.
